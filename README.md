# NTU-CZ4032
Repo for NTU CZ4032 Data Analytics &amp; Mining course project

## Overview
This repository contains all notebooks and the final report for Group 32’s SC4001 Project 2. The work is organised into three main tasks (Task 1–3), covering data understanding, model development, evaluation, and interpretation. Each notebook is self‑contained, with code, outputs, and brief commentary, while the PDF report provides a full written analysis and discussion of results.​​

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit‑learn, and related scientific‑computing tools used within the notebooks

## Usage
Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code:
- Groupid32_Task1.ipynb – Task 1 analysis and models.
- Groupid32_Task2.ipynb – Task 2 analysis and models.
- Groupid32_Task3.ipynb – Task 3 analysis and models.​​

Run cells from top to bottom; each notebook handles its own preprocessing and modeling for that task.

## Data
The notebooks assume access to the project’s provided dataset (as distributed in CZ4032/SC4001 Project 2) and read it from the paths configured inside each notebook. Adjust file paths if your data is stored in a different directory. A detailed description of variables, preprocessing decisions, and any train/validation/test splits is included in the project report PDF.​​

## Results
Key metrics (e.g., error measures for regression, accuracy or related scores for classification) and comparison plots are generated inside each task notebook. The final consolidated performance discussion, model selection rationale, and limitations can be found in Groupid32_Project2_Report.pdf.
